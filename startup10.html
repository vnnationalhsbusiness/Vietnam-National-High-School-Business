      <h1>How a Free CV Tool Built a Recruitment Empire: The TopCV Story</h1>
      <p class="meta">10:29:44 AM | 11/8/2025</p>
      <p><b>By solving the single biggest pain point for young job seekers—creating a professional CV—founder Trần Trung Hiếu built a "product-led" powerhouse that captured Vietnam's next generation of talent, transforming it into a leading HR Tech ecosystem.</b></p>
      <br>
      <figure style="text-align:center; margin:0;">
        <img src="startup10.png" alt="ADB Press Conference" class="article-img" style="margin: auto">    
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>In Vietnam's competitive recruitment market, long dominated by established players focusing on experienced, high-level corporate roles, <b>TopCV</b> emerged with a disruptive strategy. Instead of focusing on the companies first, TopCV targeted the candidates—specifically, the millions of students and young professionals struggling to enter the job market.</p><br>

      <p>Its weapon wasn’t a massive job board, but a simple, elegant, and free online CV (Curriculum Vitae) builder. This “product-led growth” strategy proved to be a masterstroke, allowing <b>TopCV</b> to build one of the largest and most active candidate databases in Vietnam, and in doing so, become a dominant force in the nation’s HR Tech landscape.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 1: The Founder’s Insight & The "Product-Led" Hook</b></p><br>

      <p>The story of <b>TopCV</b> begins with its co-founder and CEO, <b>Trần Trung Hiếu</b>. While still a student, he observed a critical, unmet need. His peers and other young job seekers were talented and ambitious, but they consistently failed to present themselves professionally on paper. They didn’t know how to create a modern, effective CV.</p><br>

      <p>Traditional job platforms saw this as the candidate’s problem. Hiếu saw it as a business opportunity.</p><br>

      <p>In 2014, <b>TopCV</b> was launched not as a job site, but as a free online CV creation tool. It offered a variety of beautiful, professional templates that were easy to use. The tool went viral. Students, fresh graduates, and young professionals flocked to the platform.</p><br>

      <p>This strategy was brilliant for two reasons:</p><br>

      <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
        <li><b>Massive, Organic Acquisition:</b> It solved an immediate, painful problem, attracting millions of users with almost no marketing cost.</li><br>
        <li><b>A Rich, Active Database:</b> Unlike static databases, <b>TopCV’s</b> users were actively creating and updating their profiles. The platform knew exactly who was ready to find a new job, what their skills were, and what their salary expectations were.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p><b>Phase 2: Building the Bridge to Employers</b></p><br>

      <p>Having successfully captured the “supply” side (the candidates), <b>TopCV</b> built the “demand” side (the employers). It evolved into a full-fledged recruitment platform, but with a unique and powerful sales pitch to businesses:</p><br>

      <p><i>“Why post a job and wait, when you can instantly access our database of millions of active, verified, young-professional candidates?”</i></p><br>

      <p>Companies, especially those struggling to hire for entry-level and junior positions, found <b>TopCV’s</b> candidate pool to be a goldmine. The platform used AI and data analytics to precisely match its candidates with job postings, delivering higher-quality leads than traditional job boards. This reversed the typical recruitment model: <b>TopCV</b> didn’t just post jobs; it delivered candidates.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 3: The HR Tech Ecosystem</b></p><br>

      <p><b>TopCV</b> did not stop at being a successful job board. It leveraged its strong position in the market to build a comprehensive <b>HR Tech ecosystem</b>. It understood that a company’s recruitment needs were complex, moving beyond just finding candidates.</p><br>

      <p>Today, <b>TopCV</b> offers a full suite of SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions for businesses, including:</p><br>

      <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
        <li><b>TopCV Apply:</b> An advanced Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for businesses to manage their entire hiring funnel.</li><br>
        <li><b>Employer Branding:</b> Services to help companies build their brand and attract top talent.</li><br>
        <li><b>HR Insights:</b> Data reports and market analysis to help companies make smarter hiring decisions.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p>From a simple free tool, <b>TopCV</b> has evolved into an end-to-end HR partner. Its success is a classic example of product-led growth: by giving immense value to the end-user (the candidate) for free, it built an invaluable asset (the database) that became the foundation of a highly profitable and defensible business.</p><br>
