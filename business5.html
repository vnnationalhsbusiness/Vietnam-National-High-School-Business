      <h1>Vietnam’s Shrimp Exports in August 2025: Sustaining Growth Momentum, Preparing for New Challenges</h1>
      <p class="meta">9:24:32 AM | 9/22/2025</p>
      <p><b>In August 2025, Vietnam’s shrimp exports reached USD 479 million, up nearly 19% compared to the same period in 2024. Cumulatively over the first 8 months, export turnover hit USD 2.97 billion, an increase of 23%, maintaining stable growth since the beginning of the year.</b></p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>In terms of product structure, whiteleg shrimp continued to dominate with over 64% market share; black tiger shrimp recorded slight growth, while the “other shrimp” category stood out with triple-digit growth, driven by strong demand for lobsters.</p><br>

      <p>Domestic raw shrimp prices remained high compared to competing suppliers, despite a slight adjustment in early September, reflecting that supply is still relatively tight.</p><br>

      <p>China and Hong Kong markets continued to shine with a 62% growth in August, bringing the 8-month export value to USD 836 million, up 75% and accounting for nearly 30% of the country’s total shrimp exports. Demand focused on live products and premium segments such as lobsters and large black tiger shrimp, helping Vietnamese companies leverage unique advantages over Ecuador and India. However, rising import inventories in China and falling local selling prices indicate potential short-term adjustments.</p><br>

      <p>In the US market, shrimp exports in August reached USD 92.6 million, slightly up 1.4% year-on-year, lifting the 8-month value to nearly USD 500 million. This reaffirms the US as a key destination for Vietnamese shrimp, though evolving trade policies pose significant challenges. The preliminary results of POR19 imposed much higher anti-dumping duties than before, along with countervailing and compensatory duties, which may considerably impact competitiveness. The shrimp industry, associations, and authorities are actively working to safeguard legitimate interests. While awaiting the final ruling, exporters are advised to exercise caution in signing new contracts and proactively diversify markets to ease dependency pressures.</p><br>

      <p>The EU market also sustained positive momentum, with exports in August reaching USD 66.9 million, up 19% year-on-year. Cumulatively, exports to the EU hit nearly USD 376 million, up 17%. Germany, Belgium, and France remained the key drivers, while the Netherlands primarily served as a transit hub. With annual demand forecast to hit record levels, the EU remains a crucial market for Vietnamese shrimp, especially for deeply processed products with sustainability, transparency, and traceability certifications.</p><br>

      <p>The CPTPP bloc posted a strong performance, with August exports exceeding USD 130 million, up 40%. Over the first 8 months, exports to CPTPP markets reached USD 829 million, up 36%. Japan and Australia were the main growth engines, driven by stable demand for convenient, high-quality products.</p><br>

      <p>In addition, markets such as South Korea and Taiwan maintained double-digit growth during the 8-month period, while Russia and Canada showed signs of stagnation.</p><br>

      <p>Looking ahead, China and the EU are expected to sustain robust growth in the remaining months of the year, while the US requires close monitoring due to tariff developments. Despite uncertainties, growth opportunities remain, supported by improving global demand, particularly during the year-end peak season.</p><br>

      <p>In this diversified market landscape, Vietnamese shrimp exporters need greater flexibility in strategy. Instead of over-relying on a single destination, they should actively tap into CPTPP, EU, and China simultaneously to balance risks. At the same time, upgrading products toward value-added lines, coupled with certifications such as ASC, organic, and sustainability, will help enhance competitiveness in segments less vulnerable to price pressures. Strengthening linkages with farming areas to stabilize supply, control quality, and manage costs will also be key success factors.</p>
