      <h1>The Global Blockchain Disruption: How Sky Mavis Built a Billion-Dollar Metaverse with Axie Infinity</h1>
      <p class="meta">10:21:08 AM | 11/4/2025</p>
      <p><i>From a small Vietnamese startup to a global GameFi pioneer, Sky Mavis defined the "Play-to-Earn" model, turning millions of players into digital asset owners and placing Vietnam at the center of the Web3 revolution.</i></p>
      <br>
      <p>While many Vietnamese tech companies focused on traditional internet services, one startup looked to the future of ownership and gaming, launching a phenomenon that would reshape the global video game landscape. Sky Mavis, the visionary developer behind the blockchain game Axie Infinity, became one of the fastest-growing technology companies in the world, proving the immense potential of the decentralized economy.</p>
      <figure style="text-align:center; margin:0;">
        <img src="startup3.png" alt="ADB Press Conference" class="article-img" style="margin: auto">    
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p><b>The Architects of the Metaverse Economy</b></p><br>

      <p>The success of <b>Sky Mavis</b> is credited to its founding team, particularly <b>Trung Nguyen</b>, the CEO and Co-Founder, whose belief in decentralized systems drove the company’s direction. Other core founders include <b>Aleksander Larsen</b> (COO) and <b>Jeffrey Zirlin</b> ("Jiho," Head of Growth), who brought international expertise and evangelism to the project. Their vision was simple yet revolutionary: shift power and wealth from the game developers to the players themselves.</p><br>

      <p><b>Axie Infinity</b> is not just a game; it is a digital nation built on the blockchain, offering players true ownership over their in-game assets—the adorable, creature-like NFTs known as Axies.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 1: The 'Play-to-Earn' (P2E) Revolution</b></p><br>

      <p>When <b>Axie Infinity</b> launched, the concept of a game where digital items were owned as NFTs was nascent. <b>Sky Mavis’s</b> masterstroke was introducing the <b>Play-to-Earn (P2E)</b> model.</p><br>

      <p><b>The Economic Engine:</b> P2E allowed players to earn tokenized rewards, primarily <b>Smooth Love Potion (SLP)</b> and the governance token <b>Axie Infinity Shards (AXS)</b>, simply by playing the game. These tokens could then be traded on external cryptocurrency exchanges for real-world money.</p><br>

      <p>This model was transformative, particularly in developing economies (like the Philippines, Indonesia, and, of course, Vietnam) where the income earned from playing <b>Axie</b> could often surpass local minimum wages. The game offered not just entertainment, but a viable new source of livelihood, leading to explosive adoption.</p><br>

      <p><b>The "Scholarship" Model:</b> P2E's virality was further fueled by the "scholarship" system. Asset owners (Managers) could lend their <b>Axie NFTs</b> to new players (Scholars) who couldn't afford the initial investment, splitting the in-game earnings. This created an organic, self-sustaining financial network that dramatically accelerated the game’s user base and economy.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 2: Building the Infrastructure (The Ronin Network)</b></p><br>

      <p>As <b>Axie Infinity</b> grew, it encountered a critical bottleneck: the high transaction fees and slow speeds of the <b>Ethereum</b> blockchain, where it was originally built. <b>Sky Mavis</b> recognized that to scale a true digital economy, they needed their own dedicated infrastructure.</p><br>

      <p><b>The Ronin Solution:</b> The team engineered and launched the <b>Ronin Network</b>, an Ethereum sidechain specifically designed for blockchain gaming.</p><br>

      <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
        <li><b>Zero Fees, Instant Speed:</b> <b>Ronin</b> offered near-instant transaction speeds and drastically reduced gas fees, making the frequent small transactions necessary for P2E (like breeding Axies or claiming SLP) economically viable for millions of daily active users.</li>
        <li><b>Mass Adoption Enabler:</b> By solving the scaling problem, <b>Ronin</b> proved that a blockchain game could handle the demands of a global, high-volume consumer product, a feat previously considered impossible in the Web3 space. This move not only stabilized <b>Axie Infinity</b> but positioned <b>Sky Mavis</b> as a leading blockchain infrastructure provider in the <b>GameFi</b> sector.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p><b>The Global Impact</b></p><br>

      <p><b>Sky Mavis’s</b> journey is a powerful case study in global disruption. By creating a fully player-owned economy, they transformed the relationship between developers and users.</p><br>

      <p>The company achieved a valuation of over <b>$3 billion</b> at its peak and, despite later market volatility and a major security breach (the <b>Ronin bridge attack</b>, which was managed and largely remediated), its core product remains a landmark in Web3 history.</p><br>

      <p><b>Sky Mavis</b> didn't just build a successful video game; it catalyzed the <b>GameFi</b> movement, inspiring thousands of subsequent P2E projects globally and firmly placing <b>Vietnam</b> on the map as a powerhouse for innovation in the decentralized digital future.</p><br>
