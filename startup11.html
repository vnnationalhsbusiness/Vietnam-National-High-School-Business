      <h1>From Reviews to Riches: The Foody Story and Vietnam's Landmark Startup Exit</h1>
      <p class="meta">10:13:49 AM | 26/8/2025</p>
      <p><b>How founder Đặng Hoàng Minh turned a simple "Yelp for Vietnam" into a food-tech giant, leading to a blockbuster acquisition by Sea Ltd. and laying the foundation for what is now the ShopeeFood empire.</b></p>
      <br>
      <figure style="text-align:center; margin:0;">

      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>In Vietnam's startup hall of fame, <b>Foody</b> holds a special place. While others became “unicorns” by raising capital at massive valuations, <b>Foody</b> wrote the playbook for a different kind of victory: the landmark, nine-figure strategic exit.</p><br>

      <p>Its journey from a simple review website into a multi-faceted food-tech platform—culminating in its acquisition by <b>Sea Ltd.</b> (the parent company of <b>Shopee</b> and <b>Garena</b>)—is a quintessential case study in product-market fit, strategic pivots, and ecosystem warfare. Today, its legacy lives on as the powerful delivery arm, <b>ShopeeFood</b>.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 1: The Founder’s Problem & The Content “Moat”</b></p><br>

      <p>The <b>Foody</b> story began in 2012 with its founder, <b>Đặng Hoàng Minh</b>. Like <b>Vexere’s</b> founders, Minh faced a uniquely Vietnamese problem: “Ăn gì, ở đâu?” (“What to eat, and where?”). In a country with one of the world’s richest and most fragmented street food cultures, there was no reliable, centralized, or user-friendly way to discover new places, read trusted reviews, or even see a menu before arriving.</p><br>

      <p><b>Foody</b> was born to solve this. Its initial strategy was not transactions, but content.</p><br>

      <p>The platform was meticulously designed to be a “Yelp for Vietnam.” It incentivized users to become “Foodies”—writing reviews, uploading photos of dishes, and adding new venues to the database. This User-Generated Content (UGC) strategy was its first masterstroke. Within a few years, <b>Foody</b> had built the largest and most comprehensive <b>F&B (Food & Beverage)</b> database in Vietnam—a powerful “moat” that competitors could not easily replicate.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 2: The Pivot from Discovery to Transaction (DeliveryNow)</b></p><br>

      <p>By 2015, <b>Foody</b> was the undisputed leader in food discovery. However, a pure-review site is notoriously difficult to monetize. The company’s leadership understood that the platform’s true value lay in its ability to close the loop: from discovering a restaurant to transacting with it.</p><br>

      <p>This led to the launch of its most important venture: <b>DeliveryNow</b>, its in-house food delivery service.</p><br>

      <p>This was a high-stakes, capital-intensive pivot. <b>Foody</b> was no longer just a software company—it was now a logistics company, managing a fleet of drivers, payment gateways, and real-time order processing. This move put it in direct competition with other emerging delivery players. However, <b>Foody</b> had a critical advantage that others lacked: a massive, built-in audience of millions of “Foodies” who already used the app to decide what to eat.</p><br>

      <p>Alongside delivery, <b>Foody</b> also expanded its transactional services to include:</p><br>

      <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
        <li><b>Foody Reservation:</b> An integrated restaurant booking system for customers to reserve tables easily.</li><br>
        <li><b>Restaurant POS Software:</b> Solutions helping restaurants digitize operations and sync with delivery systems.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p>These expansions solidified <b>Foody’s</b> position as an all-in-one platform for the F&B industry.</p><br>

      <p><b>Phase 3: The Landmark Exit (The Sea Ltd. Acquisition)</b></p><br>

      <p>By 2017, <b>Foody</b> was a dominant force, but the food delivery war was escalating and required immense capital. This set the stage for one of Vietnam’s most significant acquisitions.</p><br>

      <p><b>Sea Ltd.</b>, the Singaporean tech giant behind <b>Garena</b> (gaming) and <b>Shopee</b> (e-commerce), was aggressively expanding its regional ecosystem. Sea saw <b>Foody</b> as the perfect missing piece.</p><br>

      <p>In 2017, Sea acquired an <b>82% stake</b> in <b>Foody</b> for a reported ~$64 million. This was a blockbuster deal for the Vietnamese startup scene, proving that a local company could build a platform so valuable that a regional giant would pay a premium for it.</p><br>

      <p><b>Sea’s rationale was purely strategic:</b></p><br>

      <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
        <li><b>Synergy:</b> Foody’s high-frequency transactions (people order food daily) would drive traffic to its lower-frequency <b>Shopee</b> e-commerce platform.</li><br>
        <li><b>Fintech:</b> Food delivery was the perfect “Trojan Horse” to drive adoption for its e-wallet, <b>AirPay</b> (now <b>ShopeePay</b>). By offering deep discounts for users paying with AirPay, Sea could rapidly build a user base for its financial services.</li><br>
        <li><b>Logistics:</b> Foody’s delivery fleet complemented Shopee’s own logistics needs, creating operational synergy.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p><b>Phase 4: The Evolution into ShopeeFood</b></p><br>

      <p>Following the acquisition, <b>Foody’s</b> evolution was swift, reflecting its new role within Sea’s “Shopee Universe.”</p><br>

      <p>First, the delivery arm <b>DeliveryNow</b> was rebranded to <b>Now</b>, a simple, catchy name for its on-demand services (which also included grocery and parcel delivery).</p><br>

      <p>Then, in 2021, to complete the integration and create a single, unified brand, <b>Now</b> was officially rebranded to <b>ShopeeFood</b>.</p><br>

      <p>Today, <b>ShopeeFood</b> is a core pillar of the <b>Shopee</b> super app, fully integrated with its marketplace and <b>ShopeePay</b> wallet. The original <b>Foody</b> platform still exists as a review and discovery site, but its transactional engine has been fully absorbed and amplified—becoming the “food” button inside one of Southeast Asia’s largest technology ecosystems.</p><br>

      <p><b>Foody’s legacy</b> is twofold: it created a solution that digitized an entire industry, and it provided a landmark exit that inspired a generation of Vietnamese founders and investors.</p><br>
